# Leonard Jones Fluid 
This is my project on the computational modeling of Leonard Jones fluid using the Monte Carlo Metropolis algorithm with periodic boundary conditions. In this report, I have tried to simulate the relation between pressure and density of a randomly configured Leonard Jones fluid at two different temperatures. I have provided the code implemented in C++ with the Gnuplot script for plotting and simulating the system.
