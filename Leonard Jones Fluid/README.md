# Leonard Jones Fluid 
This is my project on computational modeling of Leonard Jones fluid using Monte Carlo Metropolis algorithm with periodic boundary condition. In this report I have tried to simulate the relation between pressure and density of a randomly configured Leonard Jones fluid at two different temperature. I have provided the code implemented in C++ with the Gnuplot script for plotting and simulating the system.
